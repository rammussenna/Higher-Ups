## Concept

In *Higher Ups*, you play as a low-level public servant or local official—climbing the ranks of power through manipulation, compromise, deception, or sheer ambition. Every choice you make affects your standing with the “higher ups” and the people below.

Progression can be **legal**, **illegal**, or **morally gray**. Success means surviving the system, not necessarily doing what's right.
